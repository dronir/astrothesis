# HY astro PhD

This is a LaTeX template for a PhD thesis in the astronomy report series
at the University of Helsinki.

Run `make` to compile `thesis.tex` with pdfLaTeX, without invoking BibTeX.

Run `make all` to compile `thesis.tex` with pdfLaTeX, using BibTex 
with `thesis.bib` as the bibliography file.

The paper size used in the report series is B5. This package supports two paper
sizes: A4 and B5, typesetting the title page to properly fit the page.

You can give the package the option 'palatino', which will change the main font
from Computer Modern to Palatino, and the sans serif font from Computer Modern
Sans to Bera Sans.
